       <h2 style="text-align:center">AZIMUTH PRIVACY POLICY</h2><br />
Azimuth SIS, LLC and its affiliates (collectively &quot;Azimuth&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. Through the use of our system, we gather certain types of information about our users, and we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that this site and our system contains links to other web sites and services. Azimuth is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other web sites, and we recommend you refer to each such other web site's privacy policy before giving out any personal information. Azimuth has two kinds of relationships covered by this privacy policy: Institutions (i.e. Schools and their employees) that use the Azimuth platform to manage their student data, as well as create and deliver courses or content for such courses; and Individuals (i.e. Students and Parents) visiting and using the Site and Institution web sites. Azimuth has no control over the use of information collected by our Institutions.<br />
<h3>Information we collect</h3>
We collect information to provide better services for all of our users, whether they be Institutions or Individuals. Additionally, as it is most likely the case that Individual information is submitted to Azimuth by an Institution, we ensure that all information concerning any Individual, regardless of its source, is treated as though it is submitted directly by that Individual, and is subject to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. While we primarily collect information directly from Institutions and Individuals, we also collect information indirectly through the use of our services.<br />
<br />
The information which we directly collect from Individuals and Institutions typically consists of the name, address, email address, phone number, and other demographic information pertaining to Individuals, as well as academic information pertaining to students, such as classes completed and academic achievements.<br />
<br />
The information we collect indirectly consists of log information (IP addresses used, times of system access, etc.), device information (hardware model, operating system, etc.), location information (GPS information if access is made through a mobile device, or other location-identification technologies), and cookies (files placed on your device which store information about your visits to our Site). <br />
<h3>How we use information we collect</h3>
We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your classmates, advertisers who may purchase ads on the site, and the developers who build the games, applications, and services you may use. For example, we may use the information we receive about you as part of our efforts to keep Azimuth safe and secure, to measure the effectiveness of ads you and others see, or to make suggestions to you relating to Azimuth features which you might find useful.<br />
<br />
An email address is needed to allow an Individual to log in and use the Azimuth system. Once you log in, you will be identified to the instructor and other students by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, email lists, and other places where names appear. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students in that course, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.<br />
<br />
Azimuth, at the option of individual classroom teachers and educational professionals, makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and other interactive communication mediums available to students from time to time. It is important to note that any information in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. The personal information you supply to Azimuth will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of Azimuth, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the Terms of Service, (iii) respond to claims that any content on Azimuth violates the rights of third parties, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Azimuth, its users, or the public.<br />
<br />
eSign: There are a variety of interactions with the Azimuth system which may require an Individual to use the Azimuth eSign Module (&ldquo;eSign&rdquo;) to confirm their acceptance of a policy, procedure, or contract terms issued by Institutions. Part of the multi-faceted approach to security and authentication of eSign involves the use of indirectly collected information, which will be displayed on the screen where necessary and become part of the Individual&rsquo;s eSign instance, or &lsquo;electronic signature&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
Links: Azimuth may keep track of how you interact with links across our site, including our email notifications, third-party services, games, and applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means, We do this to help improve our Site, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics.<br />
<br />
Third-party providers: Azimuth uses a variety of third-party services to help provide services to our Site, including: hosting and distributing photos and videos, processing payments, and analytical data to help us understand the use of our Site. These third party providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. In all cases, our partners must agree to only use your information consistent with the agreement we enter into with them, as well as this privacy policy.<br />
<br />
From time to time, Azimuth may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the service to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. Some features of Azimuth may be offered in conjunction with a partner. In order to provide these features, it may be necessary for either you or us to share your personal information with this partner. Also, please be aware that advertisers or Web sites that are linked to Azimuth may collect personally identifiable information about you. This privacy policy does not cover the information practices of those Web sites linked to Azimuth and Azimuth is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.<br />
<br />
When we provide data to our advertising and service partners, we do so only after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other data as described above.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services, and promotions.<br />
<h3>Information shared with and provided by Institutions</h3>
Individual accounts on the Azimuth system are managed by registered Institutions, and as such, your Institution&rsquo;s Azimuth Administrator will have access to your Azimuth account information, including but not limited to all communications sent to and received by the system on behalf of an Individual user. An Institution&rsquo;s Azimuth Administrator may be able to:
<ul>
  <li>Change your account password when warranted;</li>
  <li>Suspend, terminate, or delete your account (in accordance with the Institutions rules and procedures);</li>
  <li>Access information within your account;</li>
  <li>Restrict your ability to access your account or edit information therein; or</li>
  <li>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental requests.</li>
</ul>
It is important that you understand the privacy and information use policy of your Institution as that will dictate how they use the information they access through Azimuth.<br />
<h3>Information Collected with respect to children under 13 years old</h3>
Azimuth is COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) compliant. Children 13 year of age and under do not register with Azimuth or provide personal information to Azimuth without parental or guardian permission. Azimuth's policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children. If at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child's personal information, they may do so through their parent portal. Requests for information to be deleted from the system must be made directly to the Institution which oversees the data in question. Azimuth does not: collect more information from children than is reasonably necessary for their participation; entice children to provide personal information by offering the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, seek more information than is necessary to participate in the activity; or share any personally identifiable information about children with third parties.<br />
<h3>Access to and updating personal information</h3>
Azimuth gives users the ability to correct or change certain information collected during their Institution&rsquo;s system implementation. Users may change this information at any time and as necessary by choosing the &quot;My Account&quot; option available once they log into the Site. <br />
<br />
While requests to delete an account must be made to the Institution of record, residual copies of that information may remain both on our active servers, as well as on our back-up systems for a period of up to 90 days. Where required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Azimuth will ensure that all health and medical information is deleted as soon as possible, and without unnecessary delay.<br />
<h3>Information Security</h3>
We use our best efforts to ensure that all data stored within the Azimuth system is protected against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Some of our procedures to ensure the integrity of your information include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>SSL encryption;</li>
  <li>Encryption-protected backup systems;</li>
  <li>Physical security measures to ensure that unauthorized individuals 		do not have access to our servers; and</li>
  <li>Restricted access to all database and server files</li>
</ul>
We work hard to ensure that all of the data we retain is compliant with best-in-class retention policies and regulations, including HIPAA.<br />
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
In the event that Azimuth is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.<br />
<h3>Change to our Privacy Policy</h3>
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. <br /><br /><br />
